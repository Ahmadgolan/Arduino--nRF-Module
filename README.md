# Arduino--nRF-Module
Connection of two Arduino with nRF module and home appliances control

This is a practical project to control home appliances. In this project, two Arduinoes are connected by two nRF24L01 modules.
The nRF24L01 module is another functional wireless module.
The nRF series of modules are the product of the Norwegian company Nordic Semiconductor. These modules are famous for their long range and low consumption. The nRF24L01 module is a simple, accessible wireless transmitter and receiver. 
This module allows communication up to a distance of 100 meters and with different bandwidths from 256Kbps to 2Mbps.
This module is incredibly energy efficient. The current consumption of nRF24L01 in standby mode is close to zero, and only in the signal reception mode with the highest data rate (2Mbps) it flows about 13.5mA, which is still a very small amount for a wireless module. This feature helps you to easily use it in portable projects that are powered by batteries.
